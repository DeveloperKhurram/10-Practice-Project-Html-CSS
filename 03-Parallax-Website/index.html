      <h2>1. Plitvice Falls</h2>
      <p>
        Named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, Plitvice Lakes National Park
        in Croatia is the country’s most popular tourist destination. With
        nearly 1 million visitors every year, Plitvice Falls consists of a
        series of waterfalls from 16 different lakes. And with roughly 8 unique
        trails to choose from, you can take your pick of 3km to 18km routes. If
        you’re after a challenge, head to the Upper Lakes and Veliki Prstavac
        where you have the option to explore the whole park.

      <h2>2. Niagara Falls</h2>
      <p>
        Located on the border of both Canada and the US, the Niagara Falls are
        both impressively long and high. What’s more, most people aren’t aware
        of the fact that the falls are actually made up of three different
        waterfalls – the American Falls, the Bridal Veil Falls and the Canadian
        Horseshoe Falls. For a leisurely family stroll, the Niagara Recreation
        Trail takes between 1 to 2 hours for each section, so remember to pack a
        rucksack full of snacks and water! For some of the best views of the
        falls, embark on the Beamer Memorial Conservation Area Trail, which can
        take up to 2 hours. And if you’re there in the spring, look out for the
        annual hawk migration.

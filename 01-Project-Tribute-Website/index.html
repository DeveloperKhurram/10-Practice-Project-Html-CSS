          <span>Abdul Qadeer Khan, NI, HI, FPAS</span> (/ˈɑːbdəl ˈkɑːdɪər ˈkɑːn/
          ⓘ AHB-dəl KAH-deer KAHN; Urdu: عبد القدیر خان; 1 April 1936 – 10
          October 2021),[3] known as A. Q. Khan, was a Pakistani nuclear
          physicist and metallurgical engineer who is colloquially known as the
          "father of Pakistan's atomic weapons program".[a]
        </p>
        <p>
          During his time in the atomic bomb project, Khan pioneered research in
          the thermal quantum field theory and condensed matter physics, while
          he co-authored articles on chemical reactions of the highly unstable
          isotope particles in the controlled physical system.[107] He
          maintained his stance of the use of controversial technological
          solutions to both military and civilian problems, including the use of
          military technologies for civilian welfare. Khan also remained a
          vigorous advocate for a nuclear testing program and defence strength
          through nuclear weapons. He justified Pakistan's nuclear deterrence
          program as sparing his country the fate of Iraq or Libya.[108] In an
          interview in 2011, Khan maintained his stance on peace through
          strength and vigorously defended the nuclear weapons program as part
          of the deterrence policy:
